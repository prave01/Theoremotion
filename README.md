# ‚ú® Theoremotion: Dynamic Mathematical Animation Platform ‚ú®

## Description:
Theoremotion is an web application designed to **explore and visualize mathematical theorems with interactive motion graphics**. It leverages a powerful Next.js frontend, custom APIs for orchestrating local AI capabilities via Ollama, and a robust vector database for managing embeddings. At its core, Theoremotion features **AI-driven generation and debugging of Manim animation scripts**, enabling users to bring complex mathematical concepts to life with ease.

## üöÄ Features:
*   **Interactive Theorem Visualization:** Dive deep into complex mathematical theorems through dynamic and interactive motion graphics, making abstract concepts tangible and understandable.
*   **üß† AI-Powered Manim Script Generation:** Dynamically generate high-quality, lecture-ready mathematical animations using Manim. Our innovative two-stage LLM prompting system, enhanced by a vector database for contextual relevance, translates natural language prompts into precise Python (Manim) scripts.
*   **üêû AI-Assisted Script Debugging:** Automatically identify and fix issues in generated Manim scripts. Our LLM-powered debugging mechanism provides corrected scripts, detailed diagnostics, and confidence levels, ensuring smooth animation rendering.
*   **‚ö° Real-time Animation Streaming:** Experience the creation process in real-time. Stream the progress and final MP4 output of your Manim animations directly to your browser via WebSocket connections.
*   **üåå Ollama Integration:** Harness the power of local language models (via Ollama) for diverse tasks such as natural language processing of mathematical statements, generating insightful explanations, or assisting with proof construction.
*   **üìä Vector Embeddings:** Efficiently store and retrieve a vast knowledge base of mathematical prompts, Manim scripts, and their vector embeddings. This powers intelligent context-aware script generation and rapid information retrieval.
*   **üåê Modern Web Stack:** Built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript, providing a robust, scalable, and highly responsive application experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:
*   **Frontend:**
    *   Next.js: React framework for production-grade applications.
    *   React: A declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    *   TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
    *   Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
*   **Backend/API:**
    *   Next.js API Routes: For seamless frontend-backend integration and general API endpoints.
    *   Ollama: For local Large Language Model (LLM) interactions, enabling privacy-focused AI capabilities.
    *   **Groq (OpenAI-compatible API):** Orchestrates multiple LLMs for sophisticated AI reasoning, prompt generation, and debugging.
    *   **Hugging Face Inference:** Utilized for efficient feature extraction and generating vector embeddings from textual data.
    *   Hono.js: A lightweight, fast web framework used for the dedicated animation rendering service.
    *   Manim: A powerful Python library for creating stunning mathematical animations programmatically.
    *   PostgreSQL: A robust, open-source relational database, used here for storing `manim_finetune_data` and vector embeddings (replace with your actual database if different).
*   **Tooling:**
    *   Bun: An incredibly fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime and package manager.
    *   ESLint: For maintaining code quality and consistency.
    *   Prettier: An opinionated code formatter.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/theoremotion.git
    cd theoremotion
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This project uses `bun` as its package manager. Ensure you have Bun installed, then run:
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project and populate it with your environment variables:
    ```
    # Example:
    OLLAMA_API_URL=http://localhost:11434
    DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:password@host:port/database"
    GROQ_KEY="your_groq_api_key"
    HUGGING_FACE="your_hugging_face_api_key"
    ```
    *   `OLLAMA_API_URL`: The URL for your running Ollama instance.
    *   `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL connection string.
    *   `GROQ_KEY`: Your API key for Groq services.
    *   `HUGGING_FACE`: Your API key for Hugging Face Inference.

4.  **Database Setup:**
    If using PostgreSQL, ensure your database is running and accessible. You may need to run migration commands specific to your ORM (e.g., `npx prisma migrate dev` if using Prisma) to set up the `manim_finetune_data` table.

5.  **Run Ollama (if not already running):**
    Ensure Ollama is running on your system with the `mxbai-embed-large:latest` model downloaded. Follow Ollama's official installation instructions if needed.

6.  **Run the Development Servers:**
    *   **Main Next.js Application:**
        ```bash
        bun run dev
        ```
        Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the frontend.
    *   **Manim Rendering Service:**
        Navigate to the `service` directory and start the Hono.js server:
        ```bash
        cd service
        bun run start
        ```
        This service will typically run on port `4000` (configurable via `PORT` environment variable).
